ProcessManager
==============

A java application to create and run Process objects.

Very much a work in progress, but can currently be used to create a process and run it automatically.

TODO
- Separate screens for creation/display of processes
- Storing processes - Serialisation/SQLite?
- Make & use templates to create processes - eg. 'Insert a file path here'
- Log to file instead of console
